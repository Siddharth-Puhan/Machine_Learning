In this machine learning project, I delved into the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, available on Kaggle. 
This dataset encompasses critical information pertaining to breast cancer diagnoses, encompassing tumor characteristics and diagnostic outcomes. 
My objective was to harness the power of machine learning to analyze this data comprehensively. 
Through Logistic Regression, I trained a model that could predict whether the tumor is Benign(non-cancerous) or Malignant(potentially cancerous) on the basis of the inputs provided.
